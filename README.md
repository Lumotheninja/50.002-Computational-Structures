Codes for 50.002 Labs, and 2D Project's Brent-Kung Adder

## Jsim
JSim is a computer-aided design (CAD) tool that provides:\
• A simple editor for entering a circuit description (called a "netlist")\
• A choice of programs to simulate your circuit\
• A waveform browser to view the results of a simulation\
More description of JSim can be found [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2009/labs/MIT6_004s09_lab_tool_jsim.pdf)
## Labs
_Lab 1_\
Simple JSim program to simulate a transistor\
\
_Lab 2_\
Simple JSim full bit adder (FA)\
\
_Lab 3_\
JSim arithmetic logic unit (ALU)\
\
_Lab 4_\
Lab 4 is an optional lab, a simulation of a Turing machine that matches parenthesis\
\
_Lab 5_\
C code that implements bulls and cows, or Mastermind\
\
_Lab 6_\
JSim simulation of a Beta CPU\
\
I miseds 2 labs, an optional lab 7 and dropped lab 8, which are C programs
